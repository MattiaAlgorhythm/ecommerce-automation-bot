E-commerce Automation Bot

Project Description
This project is a sample automation system for e-commerce workflow management designed to simplify the order processing pipeline for an online store. It is a basic infrastructure prototype that simulates key steps in handling and automatically updating order statuses. This solution can be customized and extended to meet the specific needs of clients, including integration with real shipping APIs.

Developed in Python, this system offers the following features:

Order Registration and Management: Capture new orders and update their statuses.
Order Status Updates: Simulates an order’s journey through various statuses (e.g., "Processing", "Shipped", "Delivered").
Tracking Number Generation: Creates simulated tracking numbers for orders.
Customer Notifications: Simulates sending email and SMS notifications to update customers on their order status.
Project Features
Workflow Automation: Manages the entire order lifecycle by simulating transitions between different stages.
Customer Notifications: Provides email and SMS updates to customers on their order status (simulated).
Shipping Tracking: Generates tracking numbers for orders and automatically updates their status to "Delivered" once tracking is complete.
Project Structure
The main project structure is organized modularly to facilitate easy expansion and maintenance:

ecommerce_automation_bot/
├── app.py               # Application entry point
├── database.py          # Database management and data model
├── order_manager.py     # Logic for order handling and workflow
├── notifications.py     # Simulated notifications (email, SMS)
├── tracking.py          # Functions for handling tracking (simulated)
├── requirements.txt     # List of dependencies
└── config.py            # Configuration for API keys and parameters
Requirements
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed and create a virtual environment to manage dependencies. The required dependencies are listed in requirements.txt and can be installed as follows:


# Create and activate the virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
Functionality Overview
1. Order Registration and Management
Orders are registered in an SQLite database with details such as customer name, product, quantity, status, and tracking number.
Each order’s status can transition through various stages ("Processing", "Shipped", "Delivered").
2. Customer Notifications (Simulated)
Notifications for order updates are simulated via print statements (rather than real emails or SMS).
The notifications.py file includes functions that simulate sending:
Email Notifications: Sends updates on order status changes.
SMS Notifications: Provides tracking updates to customers.
3. Shipping Tracking Simulation
A mock tracking number is generated when an order status changes to "Shipped".
An automated function then simulates tracking updates, advancing the order to "Delivered".
How to Run the Project
Initialize the Database: Run database.py to create the SQLite database and set up the initial orders table.


python database.py
Simulate an Order Process: Use the functions in order_manager.py to create an order and simulate its journey through the different stages.

Example:

# order_manager.py
if __name__ == "__main__":
    add_order("Alice", "Smartphone", 1)       # Register a new order
    process_order_flow(1)                     # Simulate order status updates
    simulate_tracking_update(1)               # Simulate tracking and delivery
    
Expected Output: The terminal output will simulate each stage of the order process, including updates to status, tracking numbers, and customer notifications.

Next Steps and Customization
This prototype is a foundational setup that can be tailored to fit a client’s specific requirements. Future enhancements could include:

Real API Integration: Replace simulated notifications with actual email and SMS services, and connect to real shipping APIs for live tracking.
Enhanced Data Storage: Move from SQLite to a more robust database solution for production.
Additional Workflows: Extend the automation to include inventory management, returns processing, or other e-commerce workflows.
